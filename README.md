This project simulates the daily work of a **Data Analyst** in a company.  
We analyzed HR data to understand employee attrition (turnover) and provided actionable insights for the HR Manager.  
The project includes **SQL queries, Python visualizations, and a Power BI dashboard** to present results clearly.
